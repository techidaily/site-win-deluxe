### Supports Any File Recovery

One of the most common data loss scenarios is the accidental deletion or formatting of files. A good file recovery tool should provide a robust solution to restore any deleted files or incidentally lost files from formatted, raw, damaged, unallocated or even unrecognized partitions.

Whether you have accidentally deleted a crucial document or your precious family photos, no matter the [recovery file types are excel](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/how-to/recover-excel-file/), doc., PowerPoint, JPG., PNG, GIF., etc., this tool can help you easily recover them all.

## Fast and Efficient Performance

Time is of the essence when it comes to data recovery, and the [best data recovery tool](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/how-to/best-data-recovery-software-for-windows-and-mac-for-2024/) understands this well. The software is designed to deliver fast and efficient performance, minimizing the time required for scanning and recovering data.

With its optimized algorithms and advanced processing capabilities, you can expect a seamless and speedy recovery experience, allowing you to regain access to your lost data promptly.

## Comprehensive File Support

The professional data recovery software boasts an extensive file support system capable of recovering many file types. Whether you need to recover documents, spreadsheets, presentations, images, videos, audio files, or any other data type, this tool has you covered.

Its comprehensive file support ensures you can retrieve valuable data regardless of format or file type.

### Resolves Any Data Loss Situations

Apart from losing data from a formatted hard drive, there are many other situations that you faced to get the lost data back. Maybe you accidentally dragged your Ph.D. thesis into the trash can icon and then emptied it. Perhaps a sudden power outage corrupted your external drive. Or a pesky piece of malware found its way onto your computer, encrypted and holding your files for ransom.

### Scan Result List

A recommended data recovery tool understands the importance of time and efficiency in data recovery scenarios. It must offer a “Scan Result List” feature, which allows you to save each scan result.

This functionality can be a true time-saver, as you won’t have to start the scanning process from scratch whenever you need to recover data. Instead, you can access the saved scan results and continue from where you left off, streamlining the recovery process.

### Step 2: Select the Recovery Mode

![3 types of data recovery modes](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soft1-1.png?resize=960%2C600&ssl=1 "soft1")

Upon launching the software, you will be presented with several recovery modes. Depending on the nature of your data loss scenario, you will need to choose the appropriate mode:

1. **File Recovery:** This mode is ideal for files accidentally deleted or lost, but the partition remains intact and usable.
1. **Partition Recovery:** This mode is the way to go if your partition has been damaged or corrupted. It can recover data from damaged or inaccessible partitions, allowing you to retrieve your files even in the most challenging circumstances.

In more severe cases, entire partitions can become deleted or unrecognizable, rendering your data inaccessible. iFinD Data Recovery rises to the challenge by providing a dedicated “[Lost Partition Recovery](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/how-to/lost-partition-recovery-windows/)” function. This powerful feature enables you to recover files from deleted or unrecognized partitions, ensuring that your valuable data remains within reach, even in dire circumstances.

1. **Resume:** The “Resume” feature is a game-changer for those who need to pause and continue the recovery process later. It allows you to save the scan and recovered results, enabling you to pick up where you left off immediately without starting from scratch.

### Step 3: Select the Storage Device

![select the formatted hard drive](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/software1.png?resize=1078%2C547&ssl=1 "software1")

Once you choose the appropriate recovery mode, the software will display a list of partitions or storage devices connected to your system. Carefully identify the hard drive which has been formatted and select it from the storage devices display list.

### Step 4: Start the Scan

![a full scan of the lost data](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/soft3_1.png?resize=960%2C600&ssl=1 "soft3_1")

After selecting the desired storage device, it’s time to begin scanning. iFinD [Data Recovery software](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/ifind-data-recovery-software-free-download/) employs advanced algorithms and techniques to thoroughly scan the selected device, leaving no stone unturned in locating your lost files in your formatted/failed hard drive.

During the scanning process, you will have several options at your disposal:

1. **Cancel:** This option allows you to terminate the scanning process and return to the device selection screen. Use this option cautiously, as it will abort the current recovery attempt.
2. **Pause:** You can temporarily halt the scanning process by clicking the “Pause” button. Any files found up to that point will be displayed, allowing you to check if the desired files have been located. If the file you are looking for is found, click the “Resume” button to continue scanning for additional files.
3. **Real-time Display:** As the scan progresses, you will see a real-time display of the number of files found, categorized into different file types such as pictures, media, compressed files, and documents.

### Step 5: Recover Your Lost Data

![preview and recover the found files](https://i0.wp.com/www.ifind-recovery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Lost3-1.png?resize=960%2C600&ssl=1)

Once the scanning process is complete, or if you have located the desired files during the scan, it is time to recover your precious data.

Simply click the “Recover” button, and the software will guide you through saving the retrieved files to a safe location on your local disk or an external storage device.

Remember, it’s crucial not to save the recovered files back onto the same device from which they were originally deleted or lost. Doing so could overwrite or corrupt the recovered data, undoing all your hard work.

### Accidental deletion

One of the most common causes of [data loss](https://www.ifind-recovery.com/data-recovery-infographics/infographics-top-6-types-of-data-loss/) is accidental deletion. Whether it’s a simple slip of the finger or a misguided attempt to free up storage space, accidentally deleting important files can be a difficult experience.

### Hardware failure

Hardware failures, such as hard disk crashes, SSD malfunctions, or physical damage to storage devices, may lead to data loss. These failures can result from manufacturing defects, physical shocks, or age-related wear and tear.

### Logical errors and corruption

Logical errors and file system corruption can also contribute to data loss. These issues arise from software bugs, power outages, or improper system shutdowns. When the files are corrupted or the file system is compromised, it is difficult to access or retrieve the affected data.

### Malware and cyber attacks

Malicious software, viruses, ransomware, or other malicious code can wreak havoc on your data. This may lead to encryption, corruption, or even complete deletion.

### Human error and mismanagement

Human error and mismanagement can also contribute to data loss scenarios. Examples include accidentally formatting a drive, deleting the wrong files, or mishandling backup procedures.

## What is Chrome Virus Detection?

Whenever you download any file or program from the Chrome browser’s in-built downloader, it scans the file for any hidden virus or other malware at the end of the download. This scanning is performed by Google Chrome’s in-built malware scanner. This malware detection is part of the Chromium engine. So, it is available on every Chromium-based web browser such as Microsoft’s latest Edge and others. 

This feature of Chrome becomes quite handy, especially if you download any file from unknown sources. Therefore it must always be kept ON. However, sometimes it may cause trouble while you may be downloading essential data.

Due to some glitches or the browser error, the virus scanning can be stuck, and your downloading will not be completed. To fix this issue, you can disable the Chrome Virus Detection.

YES, virus detection \*can\* be harmful. I’ve used anti-virus on and off for several years now, and the only difference is that the software gorges on my processor and drive throughput and my less socially acceptable applications (e.g. Cygwin, the original Linux Emulator for Windows) become unusable, hence the reason anybody would be looking at this page. That said, I’m good, as opposed to being lucky, and thus have never caught a virus, nor experienced malware more severe than advertisement infested games, but many people do, and thus Malware Detection/Anti-Virus has a market. So really the question is Which poison to do want to risk taking?

## Can Malware Hide in Pictures?

As we mentioned, malware can hide in pictures. This is usually done by embedding malicious code into the photo file itself. When the photo is opened, the code is executed and the malware is installed on the computer. This can happen even if you don’t actually click on anything in the photo; simply opening it can be enough to trigger the attack.

Apart from that, cybercriminals can also use images to deliver malware payloads via email. They may send you an email with a photo attached, and when you open the attachment, the malware is installed on your computer.

This type of attack is known as a “malicious macro.” Cybercriminals will create a document or photo that [contains macros](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/), which are small pieces of code. These macros can be used to automatically launch programs or open files when the document is opened. And, in this case, the macro will install the malware onto your computer.

## How do Cybercriminals Insert Malware in Photos?

There are a few ways that cybercriminals can insert malware into photos.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Through Steganography

One way is to use steganography. This is a technique that allows them to embed the malware into the photo file without changing the appearance of the image. The embedded code is then executed when the photo is opened, and the malware is installed on the computer.

### Through Metadata

Another way that cybercriminals can insert malware into photos is through the use of metadata. This is data that is stored in the photo file itself, and it can include things like the date and time the photo was taken, the camera used, and the location. Cybercriminals can use this metadata to embed malicious code into the photo. When the photo is opened, the code gets executed to install malware on your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Through Watermarking

Another common technique is to watermark the photo with a URL that points to a malicious website. When someone views the photo, their browser will automatically load the website, and they may be infected with malware if they don’t have proper security measures in place.

### Through Manipulating Image Formats

Another way that cybercriminals can insert malware into photos is by manipulating the image formats. There are a few different image formats that are commonly used, and each one has its own way of storing data. Cybercriminals can manipulate these formats to include malicious code.

### Through Social Engineering

Finally, cybercriminals can use social engineering to get you to open a photo that contains malware. They may send you an email with a photo attached, and when you open it, the malware is installed on your system.

### Use a Firewall

A firewall can help to protect your computer from malware. A firewall will block incoming connections from untrusted sources. This will make it more difficult for malware to infect your computer.

### Use Caution When Opening Email Attachments

One of the most common ways that malware is spread is through email attachments. Be careful when opening email attachments, even if they appear to be from a trusted source. If you’re not sure about an attachment, don’t open it.

### Be Careful When Downloading Files

When you download files from the Internet, be careful. Don’t download files from untrusted sources. If you’re not sure about a file, don’t download it.

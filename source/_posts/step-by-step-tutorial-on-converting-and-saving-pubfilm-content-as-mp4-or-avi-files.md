## Step-by-Step Tutorial on Converting and Saving PubFilm Content as MP4 or AVI Files

### Overview

When watching online movies, some users would like to download their favorite movies for offline transferring or edition for other usage. Recently, many users are asking about how to download Pubfilm movies in Google forums and now the following article just introduces two methods to help users to download Pubfilm movies.

### Method One: Download Pubfilm movie by the Download button

After opening any Pubfilm movie, you will find a WATCH NOW button and a DOWNLOAD MOVIE button on the top of the video. Click the DOWNLOAD MOVIE button and then you will be redirected to another website called Parryplay which requires you to register before watching or downloading your opened movie. In the second registration process, Parryplay needs you to fill in your credit card information, which will prevent many users here, at least me. Because most of users would not like to submit their credit card information to the internet, which is not considered safe for their credit card. If you complete the registration required by Parryplay, you may download your wanted Pubfilm movie, but I am not 100% sure. If you want to try another safe method, then go through the following Method Two.

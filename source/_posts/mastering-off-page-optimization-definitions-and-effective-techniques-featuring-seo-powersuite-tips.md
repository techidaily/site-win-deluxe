## Definition

Off-page SEO refers to the optimization efforts that take place outside of a website in order to improve its visibility and search engine rankings. These efforts can include building [backlinks](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/), increasing brand mentions and citations, and increasing engagement on social media platforms.

## Off-page SEO tactics

Here are some common off-page [SEO](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) tactics:

### Link building

As I've previously mentioned, backlinks are considered important for SEO as they indicate that other websites consider the content on your website to be valuable and relevant. Building high-quality, relevant backlinks to a website can help to improve its search engine rankings.

### Social media marketing

Building a strong presence on social media platforms can help to increase brand awareness and drive [traffic](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) to a website, which can lead to more backlinks.

### Brand mentions and citations

Mentioning or citing a website or brand without providing a link is considered a brand mention or citation. Search engines can use these mentions to determine the authority and relevance of a website.

  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/>
</a>
<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Influencer marketing

By working with influencers in your niche, you can leverage their audience and get more visibility for your brand and potentially get backlinks.

### Online directories and local listings

Submitting your website to online directories can be an easy way to get backlinks, but the quality of these links can vary widely. Local listings in directories like Yelp, Google Business Profile, can also help increase visibility for local businesses and drive traffic to the website.

### Testimonials and reviews

By providing testimonials or reviews for other websites or products, you can sometimes get a link in return.

## Off-page SEO benefits

Here are a few ways in which off-page SEO can impact SEO and marketing:

* **Improved search engine rankings:** Building high-quality backlinks to a website can help to improve its search engine rankings. This can make it more likely that a website will appear at the top of search engine results for relevant keywords, which can lead to more traffic and ultimately more conversions.
* **Increased brand awareness:** Building a strong presence on social media platforms and engaging in public relations activities can help to increase brand awareness. This can lead to more traffic and ultimately more conversions.
* **Increased referral traffic:** Off-page SEO tactics such as link building and social media marketing can help to drive referral traffic to a website, which can lead to more engagement, more pageviews and ultimately more conversions.
* **Better user experience:** Off-page SEO tactics such as building high-quality backlinks and increasing brand mentions and citations can help to establish trust and credibility for a website, which can improve the overall user experience.
* **Increased competitiveness:** Off-page SEO can give a website a competitive edge, as having high-quality backlinks and strong brand visibility can help a website to outrank its competitors in search engine results.

It's important to note that off-page SEO should be approached together with [on-page SEO](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) as a long-term strategy and not as a one-time fix. It's crucial to avoid [black-hat techniques](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) such as buying links, link farms or participating in link schemes. A comprehensive SEO strategy that includes both on-page and off-page optimization techniques, is the best way to improve [visibility](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/), increase traffic and ultimately, convert more visitors into customers.

## IHeartRadio Music Saver: Directly Save Your Favorite Tracks

### Brief Introduction

_"Problem on how to record iHeartRadio! As a music lover, I love listening to different kinds of songs for entertainment. Recently, I came across a nice song on iHeartRadio, so I want to download it to my PC. What a pity, it's not available for me download directly from this webpage. My friend told me to record it, but I do not know how to do it. Who can help me out?-Laura"_

Originally found as iheartmusic.com, iHeartRadio got its new name in 2015, acting as a platform providing music recommendations as well as audio file collections. Audio files from 800 local iHeartMedia radio stations across the USA are available on iHeartRadio.com. However, as discussed in the above issue quoted from a forum, the large music collection can't be recorded by the website alone; in other words, we need a powerful downloader to capture iHeartRadio music.

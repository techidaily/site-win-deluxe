Google also updates it on a regular basis for tackling modern threats. However, despite such a huge status, Chrome is not free from security threats. Many users have experienced one or more of the following problems in it:

* Chrome homepage and default search engine get automatically changed and keep regularly changing, without permission from users.
* Pop-up ads keep on coming frequently.
* Some Chrome extensions and toolbar that has been removed keeps coming back.
* While browsing, they are unknowingly redirected to unfamiliar websites or webpages.

If you are also undergoing one or more of these problems, then your system is infected with Browser Malware such as Pop-up ads, Adware, Browser Hijacker, etc.

Before you read the procedure, let me warn you that you should not install any extension to accomplish scanning. Majority of the chrome antivirus extensions are failure/scam.

## Remove Browser Malware from Windows

Initially, there was a **Clean up Computer** module inside the Chrome browser. It helped users recover from unexpected changes in settings and get rid of suspicious extensions. However, it was [removed](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/03/thank-you-and-goodbye-to-chrome-cleanup.html) in 2023\. 

While you cannot request a Chrome virus scan manually but there is a way to protect your browser from malware.

For Windows users, you should enable Enhanced Protection under Safe browsing.

To do that, go to **Settings >> Privacy and Security >> Enhanced Protection**

It is set to Standard protection by default, so you will need to tick the box.

Enhanced Protection provides proactive defense against dangerous sites, downloads, and extensions by conducting in-depth scans.

You do not have to initiate anything but the scanning starts automatically when you download anything. Also, it monitors the websites you visit and extensions installed for any security conflicts. 

### Restore Quarantine Files in Windows

If you think one of your safe files is removed by Chrome by mistake, then you can restore it quickly.

* On your system open following path – **_%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Google\\Chrome Cleanup Tool\\Quarantine_**
* You will find a folder named **Quarantine**. Open it.
* Click **Continue.**
* Now right-click on the file which you want to restore and click **Extract all.**
* Enter **chrome\_cleanup** whenyou would be asked for a password, and your file will be restored.

## Remove Browser Malware from Mac

Enhanced Protection module of Chrome browser on Mac is limited in terms of functionality. It promises security by blocking suspicious pages and warns in case of password re-use.

However, downloaded files and extensions are not scanned for viruses. You must install a [reliable antivirus](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/) which will scan downloaded files for malware infection. 

Manually removing threats may be a time-consuming and difficult task that needs expert-level computer knowledge. So, we recommend professional antivirus program like TotalAV which can detect and remove all traces of virus infection. It can finish the task for you in just one click.

[Download TotalAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/)

In case you still want to take matter in you hands and make an attempt to remove malware manually. For that, you have to remove programs from your device that you don’t remember installing or the programs that appear suspicious. 

1. On your Mac device open **Finder**
2. On the left side, look for **Applications** and click it.
3. Now search for the programs that you don’t remember installing or any suspicious program.
4. Right-click on the name of that selected program.
5. Click on **Move to Trash.**
6. One by one, remove all the unwanted programs.
7. When you are done removing the programs, on the bottom, right-click on **Trash**.
8. Click on **Empty Trash.**

Your Mac system will be free from Browser Malware after performing the above steps.

## Remove Browser Malware from Android

Like Mac devices, Android devices, too, don’t have the inbuilt Chrome Antivirus Scanner. But you have another method to remove the Browser Malware. 

1\. On your Android phone or tablet, press and hold the power button.

2\. On your screen, touch and hold the power icon. It will restart your device in **Safe Mode.** You can see the ‘Safe Mode’ written at the bottom of your screen and you have access only to the system apps.

![Safe Mode in Android](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Remove-Malware-from-Chrome-Android.jpg)

3\. Now all you have to do is one by one, start removing the recently installed applications. Also, remember to make a list of apps that you are removing, so that if they are safe, you can reinstall them later.

![Uninstall Apps in Safe Mode](https://www.malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Unistall-App-in-Safe-Mode.png)

4\. After each removal, restart your device in normal mode and see if the problem is fixed or not. Until the malicious apps are caught, repeat the above step.

5\. After the problem causing application is found, you can reinstall the other applications that you have removed.

It’s kind of confusing I never did then never wanted to learn Apple or iOS so I just have to worry about Windows 10, Android Tablet & Android Phone. However, if my Tablet & Phone aren’t acting up like the article says above then I should be okay with those especially because I have a Antivirus Program on both, right. Follow up to follow no more room.

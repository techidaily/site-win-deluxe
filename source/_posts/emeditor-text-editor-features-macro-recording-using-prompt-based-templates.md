I found EMEditor to be very useful in editing very large PHP statistical database sites. For different clients I have to go in and change Form Field descriptions.  
 I found that I can ride a very large macro in JavaScript.. it works very well except when its fails. “Some of the descriptions to be changed are simply not in the file”  
 I have put in an alert to stop on such failures. However clicking on cancel does not stop the macro from running…  
 I need some way to prompt in the middle of a macro to continue, Y/N, and with a response of “N” stop execution..

 You can add  
 try { … } catch(e) { … }  
 statement to catch most errors, and use Quit() method to stop your macro. For instance:  
    
	try {  
	  ...  

	catch(e)  

	  Quit();

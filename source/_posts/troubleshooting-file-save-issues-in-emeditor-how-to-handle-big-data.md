When editing a large file of 400 MB or more the file save does not work. It looks like it works just fine, but closing and re-opening the file shows that the edit is lost. The only workaround to do a “Save As…” and replace the file later.  
 I have tried both 7.00.1 and 7.00.2 and the problem is on both.  
 I hope that you will make this a priority because our users will waste a lot of time because of theis bug.

## Definition

A permalink is a permanent URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that points to a specific blog post or web page[\[1\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/). Permalinks are designed to be permanent and never change, even if the content of the post or page is modified or deleted. This makes it easier for users to bookmark or link to specific pages on a website, as the URLs will not change over time.

## Permalink examples

Permalinks are automatically created by the website's content management system (CMS) when a new post or page is published. The permalink is usually based on the title of the post or page, and may include the date or other identifying information.

For example, a blog post with the title _10 Tips for Successful Gardening_ might have a permalink of www.example.com/10-tips-for-successful-gardening. This permalink would remain the same even if the content of the post was modified or the post was moved to a different location on the website.

## Permalinks in SEO

A correct permalink structure is important for [SEO](https://tools.techidaily.com/link-assistant/products/) (search engine optimization) because it helps search engines understand the content and organization of your website. A well-designed permalink structure can also make it easier for users to understand the content and hierarchy of your site, which can improve the user experience and increase the chances that users will link to your content.

Here are some tips for creating a correct permalink structure:

* **Use descriptive, keyword-rich URLs**: Permalinks should be descriptive and include relevant keywords to help search engines understand the content of your pages. For example, a blog post about gardening tips might have a permalink of www.example.com/gardening-tips rather than a generic permalink like www.example.com/post-123.
* **Avoid using unnecessary parameters**: Dynamic URLs often include parameters or variables that are used to identify specific content or control the behavior of the website. These parameters can make URLs more difficult to understand and may be ignored by search engines. It's generally a good idea to avoid using unnecessary parameters in your permalinks.
* **Use a consistent structure:** It's important to use a consistent permalink structure across your website to help users and search engines understand the hierarchy and organization of your content. For example, you might use a structure like "www.example.com/category/subcategory/post-title" to indicate the relationship between different pages on your site.

By following these tips, you can create a correct and SEO-friendly permalink structure that will help improve the ranking and user experience of your website.

## Permalinks vs. dynamic URLs

A permalink is a permanent URL, which means it will never change. In contrast, a dynamic URL is a URL that is generated dynamically by a website's content management system (CMS) or server. Dynamic URLs often include parameters or variables that are used to identify specific content or to control the behavior of the website.

Dynamic URLs are typically used to access content that is generated dynamically, such as search results or product listings. They may also be used to control the appearance or behavior of a website, such as by specifying the sort order of a list of products or the number of items to display per page.

Dynamic URLs can be useful for accessing and manipulating specific content on a website, but they can be less user-friendly and harder to remember than permalinks. They may also be less SEO-friendly, as they may be less descriptive and keyword-rich than permalinks. As a result, it's generally a good idea to use permalinks whenever possible to help improve the ranking and user experience of your website.

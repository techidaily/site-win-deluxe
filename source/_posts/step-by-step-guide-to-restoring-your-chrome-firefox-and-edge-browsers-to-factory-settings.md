<!-- affiliate ads end -->

* Now from the slide-out, select the **“Troubleshooting Information”** option**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/4-4.png)

* In the oncoming grey color page, look for the **“Refresh Firefox.” You can find it** in the upper-right corner of the window, under the _Give Firefox a tune-up_, section. Hit the mouse on it.

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5-3.png)

* Again a dialogue box will appear, where you’ll have to click the **“Refresh Firefox”** button**.**

![](https://malwarefox.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/6-3.png)

Now, you have successfully reset the Firefox to its default state. The refresh feature will create a new profile for the users. Firefox will store all of the critical data on the desktop in a new folder, named as “**Old Firefox Data**.”

The steps above will help you to change your browser to its default stage. But still, it won’t delete your data completely; your password and add-ons will stay in your browser, within which specific threats may hide. Hence, the steps above can’t be an ultimate solution, at times.

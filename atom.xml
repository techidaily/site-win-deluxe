Moreover, there are multiple fake update scams under the name that can seriously damage your computer.</p><p>Still, the real question is if it’s safe to use Adobe Flash Player or not?</p><p>Let us dig a little deeper to recognize the potential threats and vulnerabilities of this program. This article would discuss the controversies and how to protect our system from getting an infection.</p><p>So, without any further ado, let us get started.</p><blockquote><p> Disclaimer: This post includes affiliate links</p><p> If you click on a link and make a purchase, I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you.</p></blockquote><h2 id="What-is-Adobe-Flash-Player"><a href="#What-is-Adobe-Flash-Player" class="headerlink" title="What is Adobe Flash Player?"></a>What is Adobe Flash Player?</h2><p>Adobe Flash Player is a popular program that enables users to embed multimedia files like graphics, vectors, videos, and much more on your browser. Well, it would be better to say that it was popular. After introducing HTML5, most users preferred it instead of the Flash player for the purpose. Well, it was unable to handle massive video files and complex animation. Thus, the end was inevitable.</p><p>However, in 2013 Adobe Flash Player was among the most comprehensive tools for embedding multimedia files into a website. The report says that it used to run on 400 million computers out of 1 billion. You might be wondering what it took to bring down such a giant, aren’t you?</p><p>Over the years, it lost reputation and became less and less popular by the day. The reason being, it wasn’t competitive enough to stand with the changing technologies. Soon it lost credibility as the industry standard and was forgotten by many. Still, it wasn’t the only reason for Adobe Flash Player to lost consumers. There is another reason, and it’s the security issues that came along with the player.</p><p>Hackers and unethical developers found ways to infect a computer using the then-popular program, which resulted in mass attacks on consumer devices. That straightaway affected the company reputation, and users chose to use a more secure alternative.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >Cost of Data Breaches to Businesses - 2018 Report <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098702/14409" target="_top" id="2098702">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098702" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098702/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Is-Adobe-Flash-Player-Safe"><a href="#Is-Adobe-Flash-Player-Safe" class="headerlink" title="Is Adobe Flash Player Safe?"></a>Is Adobe Flash Player Safe?</h2><p>Well, I’m not particularly eager to defame a program unless it is a malware in reality. However, when it comes to Adobe Flash Player, it leaves me no option. It was indeed unable to keep up with the pace. Still, developers could have solved the major security vulnerabilities, which was the main reason for its fall. Long answer short, no, Adobe Flash Player isn’t safe for a variety of reasons. Let us go through some examples to know it better.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1484951/16446" target="_top" id="1484951">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1484951" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1484951/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="XMRig-Crypto-Mining"><a href="#XMRig-Crypto-Mining" class="headerlink" title="XMRig Crypto Mining"></a>XMRig Crypto Mining</h3><p>One of the attack streaks reemphasizes the need for a secure web-based tool from the developers. As per the Palo Alto Network’s security update, a next-generation malware attacks the system by posing as an Adobe Flash update. It would install <a class="link"   href="https://www.computerweekly.com/news/252450443/Crypto-mining-malware-poses-as-Flash-updates" >XMRig crypto mining code <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on the victim’s computer.</p><p>Undoubtedly, you can prevent this bogus update from infecting your computer by noticing a few minor signs. Since the fake update does not contain a digital signature from Adobe, it triggers the UAC pop-up. However, people often ignore such notifications and continue with the installation (not recommended). </p><p>Well, the malware is a crypto miner that does not cause any harm to your data. It uses your system resources to mine cryptocurrency for the developers. That would, for sure, make your computer slow. So, apart from a slow-performing PC, there isn’t much to bother if you get this malware. Still, we recommend getting rid of it before it eventually fries your circuit boards.</p><h3 id="Turla-Spear-phishing"><a href="#Turla-Spear-phishing" class="headerlink" title="Turla Spear-phishing"></a>Turla Spear-phishing</h3><p>Not all malware programs are as simple as the miner one. In early 2018 security enthusiasts discovered that Adobe Flash is a gateway for the <a class="link"   href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/turla-cyberespionage-gang-employs-adobe-flash-installer/d/d-id/1330788" >Turla APT <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> group. The group was from Russia that attacked many of the US-based consumers in the active period. The group was infamously involved in many of the illicit online activities. Some examples are spear-phishing and dropping backdoor malware on a system.</p><p>The used a somewhat similar technique as the miner one by sending tweaked update packages to consumers.</p><h3 id="The-CrescentCore-Attack"><a href="#The-CrescentCore-Attack" class="headerlink" title="The CrescentCore Attack"></a>The CrescentCore Attack</h3><p>It is uncommon for Apple users to get an infection on their system. However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.cultofmac.com/635556/crescentcore-malware-attacks-mac-evades-antivirus-tools/" >CrescentCore <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> malware was able to attack the macOS. Developers bundled the rogue program with the Flash Update DMG package. Many sites, including some high-ranking ones, were distributing the corrupted version knowingly or unknowingly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >Is CCleaner Malware? How to Clean and be Safe? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>It wasn’t clear what the program does, but it was certain that it was some kind of spyware. It was able to record all user behavior and sensitive information from the victim’s computer.</p><h3 id="The-CVE-2018-15982-Threat"><a href="#The-CVE-2018-15982-Threat" class="headerlink" title="The CVE-2018-15982 Threat"></a>The CVE-2018-15982 Threat</h3><p>In December 2018, Gigamon ATR discovered a vulnerability in the base code of Adobe Flash Player. Developers were using the loophole to distribute <a class="link"   href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-15982" >CVE-2018-15982 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to the victims. In this case, the tricky part was the developers were using a Microsoft Office document to spread the malware. </p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://dhgate.sjv.io/c/5597632/2106658/12108" target="_top" id="2106658">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/12108-2106658" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://dhgate.sjv.io/i/5597632/2106658/12108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="An-Overview-of-Adobe-Flash-Player"><a href="#An-Overview-of-Adobe-Flash-Player" class="headerlink" title="An Overview of Adobe Flash Player"></a>An Overview of Adobe Flash Player</h2><p>Are you still looking for using the Adobe Flash Player?</p><p>To be clear, understand that the program is more relatable to the WinRAR trial expired pop-up than a functional online tool. It is hardly useful. </p><p>Yes, that is what Adobe Flash Player is currently. It is a vulnerable liability that can expose your computer to multiple threats. It served its purpose in the past and opened a window for more reliable online environments to make their place. Given the current scenarios, it is still hard to believe that the Shockwave Player coined the beginning of HTML5.</p><p>However, knowing all the Shockwave player’s vulnerabilities, it is still successful in making the place in the gaming industry. A large number of online gaming websites still rely on the Shockwave player as a go-to option. Not to mention, many of them might be doing it purposefully to keep track of user behavior. Always remember, if you are getting something for free online, then you are the product.</p><p>Well, to be straight, the best way to use the Adobe Flash Player would be disabling it completely. However, if you are still unsure, you can keep it as the ask-type permission. Then, your browser will ask your permission each time a website trie to access the flash player.</p><h2 id="How-to-Deactivate-Disable-Shockwave-Flash-in-Chrome-Browser"><a href="#How-to-Deactivate-Disable-Shockwave-Flash-in-Chrome-Browser" class="headerlink" title="How to Deactivate&#x2F;Disable Shockwave Flash in Chrome Browser"></a>How to Deactivate&#x2F;Disable Shockwave Flash in Chrome Browser</h2><p>The best way to protect your device from malware that uses the Adobe Flash Player would be to disable it completely. Follow the below steps on your Chrome browser to do so:</p><ul><li>Click on the menu (three dots).</li><li>Go to Settings.</li><li>Select Privacy and Security.</li><li>Open the Site Settings option.</li><li>Look for Flash under the Content Section</li><li>You can toggle that switch to set it as “ask first” permission or block flash completely.</li></ul><h2 id="A-Few-Key-Takeaways-for-Enhanced-Cybersecurity"><a href="#A-Few-Key-Takeaways-for-Enhanced-Cybersecurity" class="headerlink" title="A Few Key Takeaways for Enhanced Cybersecurity"></a>A Few Key Takeaways for Enhanced Cybersecurity</h2><p>Disabling the Shockwave Player is always the recommended option. However, if it concerns you and you are supposed to use the Flash Player, you can do it more responsibly.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/malwarefox/products/" >How Many Ads do we See in a Day? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135415/19272" target="_top" id="2135415">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135415" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135415/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Download-Only-Official-Adobe-Updates"><a href="#Download-Only-Official-Adobe-Updates" class="headerlink" title="Download Only Official Adobe Updates"></a>Download Only Official Adobe Updates</h3><p>As it’s proven that most Adobe scams are due to bogus updates, I would recommend installing the updates directly from the official website. You might have to check for updates once every two weeks or so to have the latest version. You can also check the version history on the <a class="link"   href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe%5FFlash%5FPlayer#Release%5Fhistory" >Wikipedia page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h3 id="Install-Adobe-Flash-Player-Directly-from-Adobe"><a href="#Install-Adobe-Flash-Player-Directly-from-Adobe" class="headerlink" title="Install Adobe Flash Player Directly from Adobe"></a>Install Adobe Flash Player Directly from Adobe</h3><p>It would be best to install the Adobe Flash Player from the official site.

We would recommend you look for updates once per week or twice a month, at least.</p><h3 id="Your-Browser-Know-Better"><a href="#Your-Browser-Know-Better" class="headerlink" title="Your Browser Know Better"></a>Your Browser Know Better</h3><p>If you are using the Chrome browser, it can install the Flash update whenever available.

Cela se produit lorsque le matériel de votre ordinateur a du mal à faire fonctionner votre jeu ou fait des heures supplémentaires. S’il travaille trop, la vitesse du jeu ralentit.</p><p>La carte graphique travaille pour rendre les images fixes, ou frames, pendant que vous jouez à un jeu. Elle travaille en collaboration avec d’autres composants matériels tels que la RAM, le CPU et le GPU pour créer une expérience de jeu complète. En cas d’arrêt de l’un de ces composants, votre FPS commencera à baisser. La plupart des joueurs préfèrent un taux de 60 FPS en jouant, mais la plupart des jeux sont en fait très bien à 30 FPS.</p><p>Le PC surpasse les consoles à cet égard, car il est toujours possible d’accélérer le taux de FPS sur un PC avec des modifications, alors que modifier une console n’est pas possible. Les joueurs sur PC peuvent également augmenter la fréquence de rafraîchissement de leur écran, modifier d’autres paramètres système pour le jeu, et bien plus encore.</p><p>Cet article vous présente les réglages de performance pour les jeux que vous pouvez effectuer sur Windows 10 pour améliorer votre expérience de jeu.</p><p>Avant de commencer, il est toujours bon d’avoir un compteur de FPS dans le jeu, afin de pouvoir suivre vos progrès et tester les réglages qui fonctionnent. De nombreux jeux les ont préinstallés, mais si vous installez <a class="link"   href="https://www.msi.com/Landing/afterburner/graphics-cards" >MSI Afterburner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, vous ne serez jamais sans cet outil utile dans n’importe quel jeu.</p><h2 id="-1"><a href="#-1" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h2><p>Comment rendre Windows 10 plus rapide pour les jeux (corrections rapides)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticont.net/pages/0013/24/d54a84e68415bc2949ca1ec30e4cf5f5b067a4e1.webp"                                     ></p><p>Vous voulez savoir comment rendre Windows 10 plus rapide pour jouer avec une solution rapide ?

En voici trois que vous devriez vérifier dans le menu des paramètres du jeu avant de jouer.</p><ol><li><strong>Anti-crénelage :</strong> Lorsqu’un jeu utilise le crénelage, il corrige les petites lignes irrégulières et inégales autour de textures ou d’objets spécifiques. Pensez aux lignes floues que vous voyez lorsque l’herbe apparaît dans la plupart des jeux. Chaque jeu possède différents niveaux d’anticrénelage (SSAA, TAA, MSAA, etc.). - et vous pouvez généralement les modifier dans les paramètres du jeu pour obtenir de meilleures performances.</li><li><strong>Flou de mouvement :</strong> Pour rendre les choses plus réalistes, les jeux intègrent des flous de mouvement afin d’émuler la vie réelle. Le désactiver peut souvent vous aider à économiser de la puissance graphique.</li><li><strong>Synchronisation verticale :</strong> Parfois, lorsque vous vous déplacez rapidement, la carte graphique ne peut pas suivre et l’écran semble se déchirer en son milieu. La synchronisation verticale aide à résoudre ce problème mais ajoute un certain décalage. Une façon de corriger ce problème est d’utiliser le VSync adaptatif ou le Triple Buffering. Vous utiliserez davantage de puissance de la carte graphique, mais vous trouverez un juste milieu entre les déchirures et le décalage.</li></ol><h3 id="Mettez-a-jour-les-pilotes-de-votre-GPU"><a href="#Mettez-a-jour-les-pilotes-de-votre-GPU" class="headerlink" title="Mettez à jour les pilotes de votre GPU"></a>Mettez à jour les pilotes de votre GPU</h3><p>Le GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) est crucial pour votre expérience de jeu et pour les performances de votre PC dans les jeux, mais vous devez maintenir les pilotes de votre GPU à jour pour en profiter. De plus, un pilote obsolète peut entraîner des bogues, des problèmes et des pannes du système. Nous vous recommandons donc de prendre ce problème au sérieux et de prendre soin de vos pilotes.</p><p>Bien que Windows 10 ne mette pas automatiquement à jour les pilotes de votre GPU, les fabricants créent souvent des logiciels spéciaux sous la forme de panneaux de contrôle GPU qui effectuent des vérifications régulières des mises à jour et vous avertissent si une nouvelle mise à jour est disponible. N’ignorez pas ces notifications, car le processus de mise à jour prend peu de temps et peut vous éviter bien des ennuis pendant le jeu.</p><p>Par exemple, selon le fabricant de votre GPU, vous pouvez télécharger soit Radeon Software Adrenaline, soit GeForce Experience. Ces deux programmes vérifient les mises à jour automatiques et proposent des options d’optimisation puissantes. De plus, GeForce Experience comprend un logiciel de capture et de streaming de jeux et fournit des pilotes spéciaux Game Ready, conçus par NVIDIA en collaboration avec les principales sociétés de développement de jeux.</p><p>Vous pouvez mettre à jour votre pilote directement à partir des propriétés Windows, mais le moyen le plus sûr d’obtenir le dernier pilote est d’aller directement sur le site Web du fabricant, de choisir votre modèle de GPU et de vérifier les mises à jour.</p><p>Si vous ne connaissez pas les spécifications de votre GPU, faites un clic droit sur le <strong>Bureau</strong>, choisissez <strong>Paramètres d’affichage</strong>, puis <strong>Paramètres d’affichage avancés</strong> et cliquez sur <strong>Propriétés de l’adaptateur d’affichage</strong>.</p><p>Voici quelques liens vers les mises à jour des pilotes des fabricants les plus populaires :</p><ul><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" >Pilotes AMD <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" >Pilotes NVIDIA <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li><a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/products/80939/graphics-drivers.html" >Pilotes Intel Graphics <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li></ul><h3 id="Installer-DirectX-12"><a href="#Installer-DirectX-12" class="headerlink" title="Installer DirectX 12"></a>Installer DirectX 12</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.staticont.net/default/0012/47/72e52d810cb1f6f8d15a641fc4b287b8c43fbcd6.webp"                                     ></p><p>DirectX 12 est un outil indispensable pour quiconque souhaite jouer à des jeux sur Windows 10. Pour faire simple, DirectX est l’application que le jeu utilise pour communiquer avec votre ordinateur et lui dire quoi faire. DirectX 12 est une grande amélioration par rapport à son prédécesseur, DirectX 11, car il permet aux cartes graphiques de tirer des ressources de plus d’un cœur du processeur d’un PC, ce qui augmente les fréquences d’images, améliore les effets graphiques et réduit la consommation d’énergie. Des tests ont montré une différence de 85 à 300 % dans les performances de jeu entre la version 11 et la version 12.</p><p>Pour bénéficier des fonctionnalités de DirectX 12, le jeu doit avoir été développé avec cette version. La bonne nouvelle est que la liste de ces jeux s’allonge chaque jour, car de plus en plus de sociétés de jeux adoptent cette version.</p><p>Pour vérifier que vous disposez de la dernière version de DirectX, appuyez sur la   <strong>touche Windows</strong> + <strong>R</strong>, tapez “dxdiag” et cliquez sur <strong>OK</strong>. L’outil de diagnostic DirectX s’ouvre.</p><p>Si vous n’avez pas DirectX 12, allez-y et installez-le ; le processus ne prendra que quelques minutes. Appuyez sur la   <strong>touche Windows</strong> + <strong>I</strong>, choisissez <strong>Mise à jour et sécurité</strong> et cliquez sur <strong>Vérifier les mises à jour</strong> dans l’onglet <strong>Windows.

Ouch. Cela peut être décevant, c’est le moins que l’on puisse dire, surtout si vous êtes un joueur compétitif et que votre sortie non planifiée peut affecter vos coéquipiers ou votre classement.</p><p>Mais même en l’absence de tels redémarrages “en pleine face”, qui sont en fait assez rares, le téléchargement des mises à jour en arrière-plan limite vos vitesses de connexion et occupe la mémoire vive de votre PC.</p><p>Bien que votre première réaction puisse être de désactiver complètement les mises à jour automatiques, nous vous le déconseillons. La mise à jour agressive de Windows sans demander la permission est ainsi faite parce que dans les versions précédentes, les utilisateurs ne mettaient pas à jour de leur propre gré et leurs systèmes étaient donc régulièrement exposés aux cybermenaces. Rappelez-vous que les mises à jour automatiques de Windows ne sont pas là uniquement pour ruiner votre raid, mais aussi pour protéger votre système, le maintenir à jour et le faire fonctionner de manière optimale.</p><p>Ainsi, une autre solution plus “ douce “ et bien plus intelligente consiste à définir vos heures d’activité de manière appropriée. Vous pouvez spécifier vos horaires de jeu et de travail dans Windows et empêcher le système d’exploitation de télécharger des mises à jour pendant ces périodes. Windows utilisera alors vos heures non actives pour mettre à jour et redémarrer votre système.</p><p>Pour définir vos heures actives, appuyez sur la   <strong>touche Windows</strong> + <strong>I</strong>, puis allez dans <strong>Mise à jour et sécurité</strong> et cliquez sur <strong>Modifier les heures actives</strong>. Vous pouvez alors définir jusqu’à 18 heures actives, en laissant un intervalle de 6 heures (il faut bien dormir parfois, non ?) pour que Windows installe vos mises à jour.</p><p>Si vous êtes un joueur de nuit ou si vos heures de sommeil varient considérablement, de sorte que vous ne pouvez pas définir une heure de repos spécifique, nous vous conseillons (en plus de changer vos habitudes de sommeil) de vous assurer que Windows vous rappelle chaque fois qu’il voudra redémarrer afin que, si cela se produit pendant que vous jouez, vous puissiez toujours le retarder.</p><p>Pour ce faire, retournez à Windows Update, cliquez sur <strong>Advanced options</strong> et assurez-vous que l’interrupteur sous <strong>We’ll show a reminder when we’re going to restart</strong> est activé.</p><h3 id="Reglez-les-parametres-de-vos-effets-visuels"><a href="#Reglez-les-parametres-de-vos-effets-visuels" class="headerlink" title="Réglez les paramètres de vos effets visuels"></a>Réglez les paramètres de vos effets visuels</h3><p>Les interfaces utilisateur graphiques (IUG) de Windows 10 regorgent d’effets visuels fantaisistes. Néanmoins, ces jolis graphiques d’arrière-plan, dont la plupart sont activés par défaut, peuvent affecter la puissance de traitement disponible de votre PC lorsqu’un jeu est en cours d’exécution au premier plan. Ainsi, une façon d’optimiser Windows 10 pour les performances de jeu est de sacrifier certains, voire tous, ces paramètres.</p><p>Une fois encore, appuyez sur la   <strong>touche Windows</strong> + <strong>I</strong>.

Parmi les problèmes les plus courants à l’origine d’une baisse du nombre d’images par seconde, citons les pilotes de cartes graphiques obsolètes, les cartes graphiques de qualité inférieure, les vieux processeurs et le manque de mémoire vive. </p><p>Ce n’est pas parce que vous dépensez de l’argent pour un ordinateur qu’il est équipé du dernier cri. Le matériel est plus important que les autres caractéristiques de conception ou de logiciel.

It can help you make backup images of the whole hard disk, selected partitions or only those files that mean the most to you. When something goes wrong, Norton Ghost can <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/ubackup/products/" >restore your computer to previous functional status <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Besides, it can also help you clone one hard drive to another hard drive.</p><p>In a word, if you want to make an image back for your computer or want to clone to the new hard drive, Norton Ghost is not a bad choice. However, now Norton Ghost is <strong>no longer available for the Home user</strong>. It was <strong>discontinued by Symantec in 2013</strong>. Indeed you can still download the latest version - Norton Ghost 15, but it only offers a 30-day free trial and then you need to pay for it.</p><h2 id="How-to-Use-Norton-Ghost-15-Step-by-Step"><a href="#How-to-Use-Norton-Ghost-15-Step-by-Step" class="headerlink" title="How to Use Norton Ghost 15 Step by Step"></a>How to Use Norton Ghost 15 Step by Step</h2><p>Here in this guide, you will get the detailed steps about how to use Symantec Ghost in Windows 11&#x2F;10&#x2F;8&#x2F;7.
